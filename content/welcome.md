The trash should probably be on fire but the sun is still up in the picture so maybe it doesn't work

I've been threatening to do something like this for awhile, and by threatening, thinking, what if I put
up a blog instead of using some social media, mainly facebook products, because fuck that guy and his paddleboard.
<br><br>

I've been squatting on this domain long enough and hadn't done much with it. Spun up a static site with Prember but never
added much content. Empress looked good so I figured out how to make a theme. I miss using EmberJS for my day to day :(
This was a way to scratch that itch a little bit.

Still getting the hang of blogging in markdown, I'm using neovim and its setup to strip whitespace.
I'm sure it'll be fine, everything is fine.
