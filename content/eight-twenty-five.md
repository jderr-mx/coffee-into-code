2020 fatigue continue as I am sure it does for all of us. 
<br><br>
After binge watching all the seasons of **_Alone_** we decided we it was time to attempt to get it together. House cleaning procuring
desks for school from home so everyone has their own space. 
<br><br>
Online school started for two of the kids and whoo boy. I am sure this will be fine, but it is going to take some work. 
<br><br>
I continue to miss the tech stack I used at my last job. While not a rubyist, I have found myself missing it and wishing I was
more confident with it. Why does rubocop want me to write this line a certain way, acting like I should know? I did not know, but I wanted
to know and feel more confident with it. So I picked up a copy of _Eloquent Ruby_, it was exactly what I was seeking.
<br><br>
In other tech things, Empress blog has been a good route to exploring how Ember Addons are written. In addition to creating a theme, I've been 
trying to create a JAMStack solution to syndicating these posts to my twitter feed. Current solution is to leverage Empress' RSS feed and IFTTT. 
I guess I'll find out how it works when this posts and builds.
<br><br>
Hoping to write up the theme work I did, but first I need to document it a little better.
